# COSMIC KNOT COMPUTATIONS
This is a simple Github Codespace created to share some code for calculating the number of winning positions for different problems in the boardgame *Cosmic Knot* by Jasper Lange. All code and computations are contained in the notebook *Cosmic Knot Combinatorics*. As of now, the notebook is static and cannot be interacted with.
